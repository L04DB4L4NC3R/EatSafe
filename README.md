# EatSafe
EatSafe is a platform which combines food quality indexing using hardware with decentralization and process
tracking. 
___

<br/>
<br/>

## EatSafe uses the following

<br/>

- [X] Blockchain for food supply chain
- [X] Arduino for food quality testing
- [X] Machine learning for food quality prediction based on results of the hardware


<br/>
<br/>

## EatSafe accomplishes the following

<br/>

- [X] Food supply chain that’s un-hackable and un-corruptable 
- [X] Health standards that learn
- [X] Food and soil indexing that’s visualizable
- [X] Multilingual support


<br/>
<br/>


## How it works

<br/>

1. Users login with Aadhar card

2. Farmer tests his soil (if tier 5 or 6 farmer then no need for soil testing hardware) ,
 genesis block created in the blockchain if quality is good

3. Farmer goes to the Local market (vendor) 

4. Vendor scans farmer's aadhar card

5. Vendor connects to the quality testing hardware to his phone using bluetooth

6. Ownership is transferred and block is updated if quality is good

7. From vendor to whole seller, from whole seller to the supermarkets, repeat steps 4 to 6

8. User gets quality tested goods and can visualize the quality during each exchange

## Future Scope of EatSafe

<br/>

* Detect diseases in plants

* Distribution of left over food

* Geotagging batch productions

* Useful statistics for study of GM crops

* Seed storage share 

* Loan eligibility based on quality produced
